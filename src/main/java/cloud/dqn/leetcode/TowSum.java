 * Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/description/
    Given an array of integers, return indices of the two
    numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

    You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution,
    and you may not use the same element twice.

    Example:
    Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

    Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
    return [0, 1].

        public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {

            throw new UnsupportedOperationException();

        }
    }
}
