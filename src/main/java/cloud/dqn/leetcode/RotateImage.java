/**
 * https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-image/description/
You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

Note:
    You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to
    modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another
    2D matrix and do the rotation.
